            <hr />

            <h3>Changes in version v5.01 (FS17)</h3>
            <!-- FIX -->
            <ul class="changelogContent fix">
                <li>Fix wrong keybinding description.</li>

                <li>Fix nil ridge markers error.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- CHANGE -->
            <ul class="changelogContent change">
                <li>Mode 8: Manure transporter is renamed to Liquid product transport</li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Improved Grain Transport Mode</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vehicles at a silo should now center the trailers underneath the unloading point, no matter how far ahead the first waypoint is.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Allow reversing with tools in "Transport Mode".</li>

                <li>Disable auto field scanning on field-less maps. (Typically maps that are made for forestry only)</li>

                <li>Enabling small 0.1 steps when workWidth is over over 10.0, by holding down left Alt key.<br>We now have three steps when over 10.0: 0.5 and 2.0 for fast setting and while holding left Alt even 0.1 for fine-tuning.</li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Mode 6: Fieldwork</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Combine in this mode can now go unload like in mode 7 if there is an unload route attached to the course.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Mode 7: Combine self unloading</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Combine can now create heaps as well.</li>
                        <li>This is done by adding 2 waiting point instead of 1 (which is used to unload into an trailer). One for the heap start and one for the end of the heap.</li>
                        <li>The combine will adjust the unload speed by it self while doing that.</li>
                        <li>This is also implemented into "Mode 6: Fieldwork" for combines.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Mode 9: Shovel Fill and Empty</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is now adapted to the new bunker type.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Lights</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Now switch on an off based on it's situation. When working on the field all lights are turned on. When driving on an recorded route or unload/refill route, it will use normal street light without the work lights.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <!-- NEW -->
            <ul class="changelogContent new">
                <li>
                    <h4>CP Hud Scaling.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CP hud scales based on the UI Scale setting.</li>
                        <li>Hud scale can also be set in the settings xml now.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Added new keybinding to toggle "stop at last point or next trigger" (Have no default keybinding, so needs to be set)</li>

                <li>
                    <h4>Reversed Driving Support</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Support reversed driving for vehicles like the Valtra T Series.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>New Turn System: Stage 1</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is stage 1, which means that it only effects lane turns and not the headlands, which will be implemented in stage 2.</li>
                        <li>The new turn system works for Seeding/Fertilize and Fieldwork mode.</li>
                        <li>Turn Types: Wide Turn, Wide Turn With Avoidance (Only used in very special cases), Ohm Turn, Questionmark Turn, Forward 3 Point Turn and Reverse 3 Point Turn.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>New Save System</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each course is now saved in there own xml file inside <code>CoursePlay_Courses\(mapId)\courseStorageXXXX.xml</code> where XXXX is represented by an number.</li>
                        <li>There is a <code>CoursePlay_Courses\(mapId)\courseManager.xml</code> file there as well to control what course storage file is for which course. This file also controls folders.</li>
                        <li>All courses are saved outside the savegameX folder and will be available for each savegame that uses the same map, so no need to rerecord any courses for the same map once you starting an new savegame.</li>
                        <li>This also improves the loading time and fixes the problem with xml files getting to big to be saved.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>New BunkerSilo Mode</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>New mode that allows using a shield to level and compacting the new bunkersilo system.</li>
                        <li>Tractors with an shield will clear out of the silo once it registers an incoming vehicle that want's to unload in the silo.</li>
                        <li>Vehicles that are coming in to unload will wait until the tractor with an shield have cleared out of the silo.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
								<li>
									<h4>New Course Generation</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>generates tracks in any direction</li>
										<li>finds the optimum angle, that is the direction the parallel tracks must run in order to have the minimum number of turns.</li>
										<li>makes a best effort to find an angle for non-convex fields which results in continuous tracks</li>
										<li>start the headland tracks at any location.</li>
										<li>link the headland tracks with the parallel track (remember, the parallel tracks start location changes with the angle)</li>
										<li>generate course starting in the center and finishing with the headland for sowing and any fieldwork other than harvesting</li>
										<li>turn maneuvers for combines on headland corners</li>
										<li>non-convex fields: can generate path for non-convex fields. This is an experimental feature. If there is no convex solution for a field or the non-convex solution results in significantly less tracks it'll choose the non-convex solution. A non-convex solution will always have the middle of the field divided in two or more blocks which will be worked one by one. Once a block is finished, the course will lead to the next block on the innermost headland path. This is not optimal but will cover the entire field and the course will always remain within the field. In general, the algorithm will try to create the minimum amount of blocks and avoids creating blocks with just a few tracks.</li>

			</ul>

			<!-- NEW -->
			<ul class="changelogContent new">
				<li>
					<h4>Automatic and manual field scanner</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Courseplay can scan the map's fields to generate an border path (field edge path). No need to drive around the field anymore.</li>
						<li>In an existing savegame, this option is activated by default. When starting a new savegame, there will be a dialog asking you to activate/deactivate it. The setting can be activated/deactivated in the <code>courseplay.xml</code> file.</li>
						<li>In addition, single fields can be scanned manually (when the vehicle is on the field) and saved. These fields are saved in the <code>courseplayFields.xml</code> file.</li>
						<li>Thanks to upsidedown for the initiation and help</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h4>Driver wages</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Drives are now paid wages:
							<ul>
								<li>easy: € 500 / hour</li>
								<li>medium: € 1,000 / hour</li>

					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>Active drivers are displayed on the ingame map. This can be toggled in the <code>courseplay.xml</code> file. Additionally you can choose if the vehicle name and current course name should be displayed.</li>

				<li>
					<h4>Reverse unloading in silage silos</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Unloading in silage silos can now be done in reverse</li>
						<li>Record the route without an trailer as if the tractor was the trailer and reverse to the backend of the silage bin and change to forward again and continue the route</li>
						<li>Unloading will be done from the rear end of the silage silo</li>
						<li>For better handling, unloading will start a couple of silo sections before to build up and ramp</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>Auto ridgemarkers settings are now saved in/loaded from the <code>vehicles.xml</code> file.</li>

				<li>Shovel positions are now saved in/loaded from the <code>vehicles.xml</code> file.</li>

				<li>the Courseplay version is now displayed in the hud, allowing everyone to easily report it when needed</li>

				<li>
					<h4>Customizable hud position</h4>
					The hud position can now be easily set by the user in the <code>courseplay.xml</code> file.<br />(<code>&lt;courseplayHud posX="0.433" posY="0.002" /&gt;</code>)
				</li>

				<li>
					<h4>Mouse wheel usage</h4>
					Any number and list values can now be set by using the mouse wheel (when hovering over the value or list). <br />
					<span class="emphasize2">Note: while the mouse cursor is active, the vehicle's zoom function is disabled.</span>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h4>Reversing with trailers</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Trailers can be driven around a curve.</li>
						<li>Only one trailer is supported, not multiple simultaneously.</li>
						<li>The tractor will align the trailer according to the next waypoint, so there should be enough lateral space.</li>
						<li>The course should be recorded without a trailer attached, so the real intended course is recorded instead of the tractor's steering.</li>
						<li>Be aware of the trailer's length; the radius around curves shouldn't be too narrow.</li>
						<li>When driving backwards, the tip trigger will be found <span class="emphasize2">behind the trailer</span>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>When approaching refill triggers (e.g. seed, fuel, liquid manure, &hellip;), the vehicle now slows down to avoid hard braked stops</li>

				<li>
					<h4>Completely new course management system</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Folders, baby! Courses (and folders) can now be moved into folders for better overview</li>

						<li>new low-poly signs with new textures</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h4>Unloading on field</h4>
					Baleloaders can now automatically unload on the field if no unloading course has been appended.
				</li>

				<li>
					<h4>Traffic collision raycast</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Earlier recognition of traffic ahead, meaning early enough braking</li>
						<li>Traffic will not only be recognized straight ahead, but actually around the corner (where your vehicle is going)</li>
						<li><span class="emphasize2">(Only in combi mode)</span> On the way to and from the combine, objects with a collision (trees, other vehicles) will be bypassed by swerving left or right</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h4>Optional symmetric lane change</h4>
					<span class="emphasize1">Please see the <a href="../faq/index.html">FAQ</a></span> for further information <span class="emphasize2">(&ldquo;How to use the offset? — a.k.a. how do I let multiple vehicles drive a fieldwork course?&rdquo;)</span>.
